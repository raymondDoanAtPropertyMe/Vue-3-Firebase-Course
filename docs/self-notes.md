# Vue JS 3 Tutorial for Beginners

This will be notes of the course.

## #1 - Introduction

### Vue Widgets

Vue components to be created to drop into a page (either Vue or non-Vue):

- The component state would be managed based on that page, independent of the other states if the component is used elsewhere.

### Vue Websites

Creating a SPA (Single Page Application) and is most commonly used. Vue's SPA intercepts the requests from the client and retriggers it, when normally they are sent to the server.

### Vue 3 New Features

- Composition API: `setup()` function is all we need to do this (will be in Part 9)
- Multiple Root Elements: Many root elements side by side
- Teleport Component: render content from one component in a different place in DOM
- Suspense Component
- TS Support
- Improved reactivity & performance gains
